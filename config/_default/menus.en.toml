# -- Main Menu --
# The main menu is displayed in the header at the top of the page.
# Acceptable parameters are name, pageRef, page, url, title, weight.
# 
# The simplest menu configuration is to provide:
#   name = The name to be displayed for this menu link
#   pageRef = The identifier of the page or section to link to
#
# By default the menu is ordered alphabetically. This can be
# overridden by providing a weight value. The menu will then be
# ordered by weight from lowest to highest.

# url parameter is needed to link pages correctly on Netlify deploy.
# Not sure why but set url equal to a page's relative url

[[main]]
  name = "Blog"
  pageRef = "blog"
  url = "//blog/"
  weight = 10

[[main]]
  name = "Schedule"
  pageRef = "schedule"
  url = '//schedule/'
  weight = 20

[[main]]
  name = "PSAs"
  pageRef = "PSAs"
  url = '//psas/'
  weight = 25

[[main]]
  name = "About"
  pageRef = "about"
  url = '//about/'
  weight = 30


# -- Footer Menu --
# The footer menu is displayed at the bottom of the page, just before
# the copyright notice. Configure as per the main menu above.

# [[footer]]
#   name = "Tags"
#   pageRef = "tags"
#   weight = 10
